There are different objects to consider when counting. The main page contains 
the 5 subjects. The main page is the object 1. The status should be:

	Retrieving objects (0/1)

Once retrieved, the 5 subjects should be added to the number of objects, then 
the status is:

	Retrieving objects (1/6)

Once the first subject notice page is loaded, we can count how many notices we 
have. Imagine there are 10 notices, the status is:

	Retrieving objects (2/16)

Now we can choose between explore other subjects, or continue in depth with the 
actual one. Let's do the latter. Exploring a notice, brings the attachment list.  
Imagine for the firts notice, we have 3 attachments. The status:

	Retrieving objects (3/19)

And so on. The different objects are:

	The main page with the subject list.
	The list of notices in a subject.
	The list of assignments in a subject.
	The notice page.
	The assignment page.
	An attachment from a notice.
	An attachment from a assignment.
